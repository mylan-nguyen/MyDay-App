----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is our proposal-based project for **TOHacks 2022**. We want to design an application that encourages meaningful, outdoor activities on a daily basis. See what how you score up completing daily activity goals against your friends.

## Application Flow
1. Register for an account or sign in.
2. Check for the daily objective.
3. Post a video of yourself completing the daily objective.
4. Receive an achievement and notify others in their feeds.
